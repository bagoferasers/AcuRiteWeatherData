# AcuRiteWeatherData
We have an AcuRite weather station that we enjoy checking the differences between weather app predictions, 
local stations, and acutal readings from our house. I thought it would be a fun project to download the weather data 
from the sensors and write a python program that plots the data. I am not a huge fan of the mobile app that came with 
the AcuRite station, so this project solves that issue for me.
